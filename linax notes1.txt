Linux By Mr. Ashok | Session - 02 | Linux Basic Commands



-> os act as a mediator between users and computer hardware component.
->os provides user interface to work with computer.
->os is mandotry to use any computer.
Ex: Windows, Linux, MAC, Android & IOS etc....

-> Windows is single user based OS
-> Windows is paid software
-> Windows developed by Microsoft
-> Security features are less in windows OS
-> Recommended for personal use


-> Linux is free & Open source OS
-> Linux is multi user based OS
-> Security is high in Linux
-> It is recommended for Severs, Databases, Applications execution
-> Linux is community based OS
-> Linux OS developed by 'Linux Torvalds'

Linux Distributions /Flavors
->Red Hat
->Amazon Linux
-> ubuntu
->cent Os
->SUSE
->Kali Linux
->Debian Linux
->Fedora ..etc
Note:200+Linux Distributions are avalible


*******************************
Linux Envirolnement SetUp
****************************
->we can install using Virtual Box(HyperVisior/VM Ware)
->we can use cloud provided Virtual Machine (Aws Ec2)


************
Linux commands
*************
Linux vm we will use with the commands
->in Linux everything will be represented as a file 
->NormalFiles(text files)
->Directories(Folder)

/////////Create Directories//////////////////

->mkdir directory (To create a folder)
->rmdir directory (To delete folder)
->pwd (Present working directory )
-> cd directories(to change directories)
->directory cd .. to go back 
-> to delete a empty directory(rmdir filename.txt)
->To delete a content directories(rm -r directory name)
->To move the files from one directory to another directory(mv directory another directoruie)



////////create a Text file///////////////
->to create a empty file (touch filename.text)
->To create content file(cat > filename.txt).To save CTRL+D
->To read txt file(cat filename)
->To update the text (cat >> filename.txt)
->To delete the text file(rm filename.txt)
->To rename a text file(mv presentfile changedfilename)
-> to copy the one file content to another file(cat filename > second filename)
->To copy the multiple files data(cat filename.txt secondfile.txt >thirdfile.txt)


////////To read the files in different ways///////////////
->To read the text file in reverse order(tac filename.txt)
->To read the from top  10 lines of the file(head filename.txt)
...To read first top 30 lines (head -n 30 filename.txt)
->To read the from bottom  10 lines of the file(tail filename.txt)
...To read bottom  30 lines (tail -n 30 filename.txt)
...to read form 30 th line(tail +30 filename.txt).
->To print the no of characters and words in the file(wc filename.txt)



////////////////GREP///////////
->GREP stands for global Regular Expression print
->GREP command for command will process the text line by line it prints the lines which are matched with given pattern
->grep 'searched text ' filename.txt(case sensitive)
->grep -i 'searched text' filename.txt(not case sensitive)
-> grep -i 'searched Text' *(it will search the text in all the files)
->grep -R 'searched Text' (it will search the pwd and sub directives also)



////Text editor //////////////////
-> In Windows OS Notepad is the default text editor (It in default in Windows)
-> In Linux OS we will use 'VI' text editor (It is default in Linux)
$ vi ashokit.txt
-> press 'i' in keyboard to enter into "insert mode'
-> write the data in the file
-> Press 'Esc' then press :wq to save and close that file
I
Note: To close the file without saving we will use ==> :q!


///////////////SED Command/////////////////
->SED stands for stream editor
->using SED command use to replace the text without opening the file
->it will replace the Linux word with Unix and print output in the terminal .but it will not save the file
->sed 's/Linux/unix/' filename.txt.

->it will replace the Linux word wit unix and it will  save the file.
->sed -i 's/Linax/Uinax/' filename.
->delete the last line of the file (sed -i '$d' filename.txt)
->to delete the text from nth line in the text file(sed -i '12,$d' filename.txt)




///////////////////File Permission In Linax///////////////
->A file can have  3 Permission
1.Read
2.Write
3.execute
->File Permissions are devided into 3 sessions
section-1:User Permission(first 3  characters represents user permissions)
 section-2:Group Permission(from 4 th to 6 th   characters represents group  permissions)
section-3:other Permission(from 7th  to 9 th   characters represents others permissions)


/////Modify file Permission ///////

/////user////////////////
->using 'chmod' command we can change the file permission.
->using 'chmod' command we can add and remove permission.
->add execute permission for the user (chmod u+x filename.txt)
->remove execute permission for the user(chmod u-x filename.txt)


/////////////group///////////////
->add execute permission for the group (chmod g+x filename.txt)
->remove execute permission for the user(chmod g-x filename.txt)
->remove write and execute permission from the group (chmod g-wx filename.txt)

//////////////other/////////////

->add execute permission for the other (chmod o+x filename.txt)
->remove execute permission for the other(chmod o-x filename.txt)


->0 no permission
->1 only execute
->2 only write
->3 Execute and write
->4 only read
->5 Read & Execute
->6 Read & write
->7 Read & Write & Execute

chmod 777 players.txt

user Read & Write & Execute

group Read & Write & Execute

other Read & Write & Execute

####################working with  user accounts in Linux ############
-> Linux multi user operating system
->with in one Linux machine we can create a multiple user accounts
->Multiple users can access one Linux at a time and they can perform Multi-tasking

->Every Linux machine have root account (super user)
->when we launch  a Linux vm using "amazon Linux AMI "we will get ec2-user as a default user
->to go to root user(sudo su)
->to go back to user(exit)
-> to perform admin activities we will use 'sudo' permission


//////////////////Create a user in Linux/////////////////
create a user 
(sudo useradd <username>).
->Verify your account details
(id username).

How to display the users list
->cat /etc/passwd

delete the user
sudo userdel username

/////group creation///////////
->create  a group
 (sudo groupadd groupname).
->add user to group
 (sudo usermod -aG groupname username)
->Remove user from the group 
sudo gpasswd -d username groupname
->Delete the group 
sudo groupdel groupname
How to display the groups list
->cat /etc/group
->print the users belongs to particular group 
sudo lid -g groupname
